Repository for code developed while learning to code

I am currently working from home during the COVID-19 event, and I have some timeavailable to learn new skills.  I showed some apptitude for programming in college, but never pulled that string.  I am doing so now. My goals, in order, are to:
1. learn Javascript
2. learn html
3. learn CSS
4. learn Python

Ultimately, I want to be able to play in the data analysis world ultimately.

Recently, to date I have completed the JS intro to programming modules on Kahn Academy.  I am looking for a deeper, self-directed dive.
